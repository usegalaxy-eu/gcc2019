Automatic generation of badges
==============================

- Install [InkscapeGenerator](http://wiki.colivre.net/Aurium/InkscapeGenerator) extension of Inkscape
- Create a `registration.csv` file with at least 3 columns named `id`, `name`, `affiliation`
- Run the InkscapeGenerator 
- Check the `badges` folder: one pdf per line of `registration.csv` should have been created
